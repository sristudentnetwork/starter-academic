The SRI Student Network (SSN) is a graduate student-run group at Sunnybrook whose mission is to encourage and foster relationships amongst the greater graduate student population at Sunnybrook. We would like to take this opportunity to invite you to join our network of graduate students working at Sunnybrook. Our team recognizes the challenges of connecting with SRI graduate students from different platforms and departments and hopes to close that gap. 

Overall, the SSN aims to provide accessible professional development programs, on-site fitness and mental health resources, and social and research networking opportunities to graduate students at SRI. Some of the SSNâ€™s existing initiatives include monthly Newsletters to showcase novel research and technology at Sunnybrook, monthly coffee hours to encourage inter- and intra- platform student relationships, academic events including alumni career panels and conferences, as well as social events including, but not limited to, game nights and holiday parties. 

Current membership: Moses Cook (President), Nadia Bragagnolo (Vice President), Jaykumar Patel (Communications Officer), Rosa Sommer (Financial Officer), Justin Pogmore (Chief Returning Officer), Ann Fernando (Events Coordinator), Ajay David & Nicole Cappelletto (The Takeaway Editors), Calder Sheagren (Webmaster), Claire Mazzia and Yuen Yan Wong (GPSN Members), Ella Bing Song, Di Yu, Daniel Djayakarsana
